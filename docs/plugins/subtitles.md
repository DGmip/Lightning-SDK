# Subtitles

You use the *Subtitles* plugin to easily display Subtitles (or Closed Captions) in your App.

The plugin comes with some basic styling of Subtitles and offers the option to customize some of them, such as fontSize, colors and positioning.

> The Subtitles plugins in the Lightning-SDK only offers an API for displaying Subtitles.<br /><br />
> Retrieving subtitles from a video stream or a remote API is not part of the Plugin's functionality as it's very App and / or Platform specific.


## Usage

If you want to display Subtitles in your App, first import the Subtitles plugin from the Lightning SDK:

```js
import { Subtitles } from '@lightningjs/sdk'
```
