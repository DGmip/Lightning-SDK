# FPS counter

Frames per second (FPS) is an important measure for the performance of your App. A higher FPS indicates a smoother experience.
When validating an App on a certain platform it's useful to get an indication of the FPS score.

The SDK contains a built-in **FPS counter** that can be turned on or off via the [Platform Setting](/plugins/settings?id=platform) `showFps` in `settings.json`.

When enabled a _real-time_ counter with the current FPS will be displayed as an overlay in the top left corner of the App.
